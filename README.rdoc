== DoneList

DoneList is an app to track the things you do each day. Rather than thinking of everything you have to-do (which can be incredibly demotivating), focus instead on the things you accomplish. It can help you change your orientation to be more productive.

Details:

* Ruby 2.2.4

* Rails 4.2.5

I'll update this more as I add functionality.
